									<h2>Objectives</h2>
									<blockquote>
                                        <li>Address the rising mental health challenges experienced by students in academic settings</li>
                                        <li>Identify key stress-driving factors across psychological, social, and academic domains</li>
                                        <li>Understand how various lifestyle habits, academic pressures, and interpersonal dynamics influence stress</li>
                                        <li>Help educators and institutions enhance curricula and support systems based on data-driven findings</li>
                                        <li>Provide actionable insights to guide the development of stress-management interventions and wellness programs</li>
                                        <li>Raise awareness among policymakers and school administrators about the urgency of student mental health</li>

									<h2>Methodology</h2>
									<blockquote>
                                        <li>Utilized a Kaggle dataset with 1100 entries and 21 features covering psychological, physiological, environmental, academic, and social factors</li>
                                        <li>Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to validate data quality — no missing values or outliers were found</li>
                                        <li>Used correlation analysis and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify key variables and address multicollinearity</li>
                                        <li>Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets, and used 10-fold cross-validation for reliable model evaluation</li>
                                        <li>Trained Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and SVM models to classify stress levels</li>
                                        <li>Tested four modeling strategies: no preprocessing, PCA for feature reduction, removal of correlated variables, and parameter tuning via Grid Search</li>
                                        <li>Selected the best model based on test accuracy and generalization capability</li>
                                        <li>Identified depression, academic performance, and self-esteem as the top contributors to student stress</li>

                                                Our correlation analysis revealed strong associations between stress levels and a range of independent factors, including depression, self-esteem, academic performance, and future career concerns.</p>
