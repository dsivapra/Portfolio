                                            Two datasets from Kaggle were used to conduct this analysis. The <strong>TSA Claims Database</strong> includes property and injury claims filed from 2002 to 2015, providing details like incident date, airport, airline, and claim type. It helped calculate the number of claims filed per airline and airport. The second dataset, <strong>US Airline Flight Routes and Fares</strong>, spans from 1993 to 2024 and offers insights into passenger volumes by airport and quarter. This allowed us to normalize claim counts by passenger traffic, offering a fair comparison of claim rates across locations and carriers.

                                                <strong>Airports:</strong>
                                                <strong>Is there a difference in the claim rate across airports?</strong><br>
                                                Yes â claim rates vary across major airports.<br>
                                                SFO reported the fewest claims, indicating fewer issues or better operations.<br>
                                                ORD had the highest number of claims filed, signaling potential gaps in handling or procedures.

                                                <strong>Does the claim rate differ by quarter when analyzed?</strong><br>
                                                Yes â claim rates fluctuate based on the time of year.<br>
                                                LAX, JFK, and DFW showed significant seasonal differences.<br>
                                                Q3 (summer) recorded the highest claim rates, possibly due to increased travel and congestion.<br>
                                                Q4 (winter) had the lowest, suggesting a safer or more efficient travel period.

                                                <strong>Is there a variation in the claim rate by airline?</strong><br>
                                                Yes â airlines differ in how frequently claims are filed.<br>
                                                Southwest Airlines had the fewest claims, reflecting potentially stronger baggage or service protocols.<br>
                                                American Airlines had the most, suggesting room for operational improvements.
